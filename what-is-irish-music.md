What is traditional Irish Music?
================================
{:.no_toc}

* TOC
{:toc}

Here's one definition:

<fieldset>
Irish music is very specific: specific tunes in specific rhythms, played in specific ways in specific keys on specific instruments. You can’t walk into a session unprepared and unschooled and expect to bluff your way through it. You either know how to play this music or you don’t; you’ve either listened to lots of it or you haven’t." 
<a href="https://books.google.co.nz/books/about/Field_Guide_to_the_Irish_Music_Session.html?id=IkgGAAAACAAJ&redir_esc=y">Barry Foy, Field Guide to the Irish Music Session (Boulder, Colorado, 1999)</a>
</fieldset>
<br />

**It's NOT:**

* A Celtic Jam
* Country and Western, Bluegrass, Jazz, Blues...
* U2, The Pogues, Thin Lizzie, nor is it Daniel O'Donnell or songs like "I'll take you home again, Kathleen" or "Danny Boy".

The occasional song is sung but if you're in doubt, ask someone who looks as if they're an experienced player if they reckon would your version of "When Irish Eyes are Smiling" accompanied on the Stylophone be OK. By the way, the answer is probably no.

Tunes
-----
You can find lots of examples of the tunes we're talking about on this site - see our <a href="/current_tunes/">Current Tunes</a> page.



Rhythms
-------
The music is primarily tunes for traditional Irish dancing:

* Reels
* Jigs
* Polkas
* Hornpipes
* Slides
    
But there are also tunes like Slow Airs which are for listening - they're reflective music. Sometimes these are the music for a song, sometimes not.

Instruments
-----------

These melody instruments are the backbone of the music - this is where the pulse of the music happens. They dictate the rhythm and speed of the tunes:

* Fiddle
* Flute
* Whistle
* Accordian
* Concertina
* Banjo
* Mandolin
* Uilleann Pipes
* Harp

You'll probably see some or all of these at a session depending on where you are - pipes and harp are probably less common.

If you have an instrument that you want to play melody on that isn't listed above then perhaps you might want to reconsider. Again ask someone!

Unlike lots of other music we're familiar with where e.g. drums, bass and rhythm guitar set the rhythm, traditional Irish music uses instruments like these in a different way:

* Guitar
* Bouzouki
* Bodhran

First of all, they aren't necessary for the music to work. If there's several of these instruments then almost all of them should probably just sit and listen. Or take it in turns.

If you have an instrument that you want to play accompaniment on that isn’t listed above then perhaps you might want to reconsider. Again ask someone!
